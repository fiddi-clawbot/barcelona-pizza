# Pizzeria Beddia

## The Story

Pizzeria Beddia brought the obsessive Neapolitan tradition to Barcelona. Every pizza is a study in balance: carefully selected San Marzano tomatoes, imported mozzarella di bufala, and dough fermented for 72 hours.

Marco Beddia's approach is uncompromising. The 5-person team maintains strict standards—limited seating, no shortcuts, complete focus on the craft. The pizzaiolo's hands move with surgical precision. Water temperature, dough hydration, oven temperature—nothing is left to chance.

## The Experience

Walk in and you're immediately aware this isn't casual dining. The open kitchen dominates the intimate space. You watch the pizza come together: gentle stretching of dough, precise placement of toppings, swift rotation in the wood-fired oven.

The pies emerge with leopard-spotted crusts—evidence of the 90-second bake at 450°C. The interior is soft, pillowy, slightly charred at the edges.

## Signature Pizza

**Margherita** — This is the true test of a Neapolitan pizzeria. At Beddia, it's transcendent. The dough has complex fermentation flavors. The tomato's acidity cuts through fresh mozzarella. The basil is aromatic, almost essential.

## Why It Matters

Beddia proved that Barcelona could support world-class Neapolitan pizza. It inspired a new generation of pizzerias to take fermentation, sourcing, and technique seriously.

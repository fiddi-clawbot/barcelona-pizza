# Franco Pepe

## The Philosophy

Franco Pepe doesn't follow the Rome-Naples pizza narrative. Instead, he champions regional Italian traditions—specifically Umbrian sourcing and technique.

The flour comes from specific mills in Umbria. The tomatoes are from a single farm. The olive oil is DOP certified. This isn't performative localism—it's authentic deep-rootedness in place.

## The Experience

The space feels lived-in and warm. Wooden tables, soft lighting, the aroma of wood smoke. You might start with crescia (a traditional Umbrian bread), move to pizza, and finish with handmade pasta. Each dish builds on the same philosophy: respect ingredients, honor tradition, execute perfectly.

The pizzas are thinner than Neapolitan style but thicker than Roman—a distinctly Umbrian approach.

## Signature Pizza

**Tartufo & Ricotta** — When white truffles are in season, this pizza is extraordinary. Creamy ricotta, thin shavings of black truffle, mozzarella, and a hint of cream. Complex, earthy, elegant.

**Mortadella & Pecorino** — The mortadella is sourced from a producer in Umbria. The pecorino is aged 24 months. The simplicity allows both ingredients to shine.

## Why It Matters

Franco Pepe represents regional pizza diversity. Not everything needs to be Neapolitan or Roman. Local traditions have merit and deserve respect.

# Can Culleretes

## The History

Can Culleretes is Barcelona's oldest restaurant, operating since 1786. Seven generations of the same family have maintained standards while evolving with the city.

Recently, the family introduced a pizza program that respects both Italian tradition and Catalan identity. It's a fascinating conversation between two cuisines.

## The Approach

The pizzas are wood-fired but use Catalan ingredients when possible. The flour is sourced from local mills. The tomatoes are from Spanish farms. The mozzarella is still imported, but the overall sensibility is rooted in place.

This creates a hybrid pizza tradition—neither purely Italian nor purely Catalan, but genuinely Barcelona.

## Signature Pizza

**Pan Amb Tomàquet** Pizza — A play on the iconic Catalan bread with tomato. Local tomato, local olive oil, fresh bread-style crust. Simple, delicious, rooted in Barcelona food culture.

**Calcots & Romesco** — When calcots (sweet spring onions) are in season, this pizza celebrates them. Charred vegetables with romesco sauce and mozzarella. Seasonal, local, deeply Catalan.

## Why It Matters

Can Culleretes shows that pizza doesn't need to be purely Italian to be excellent. Regional traditions can merge, creating something new while honoring both cultures.

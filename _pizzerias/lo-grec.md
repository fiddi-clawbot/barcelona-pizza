# Pizzeria Lo Grec

## The Concept

Pizzeria Lo Grec takes Neapolitan fundamentals and reinterprets them with Barcelona ingredients and modern technique. The result is pizza that honors tradition while being unmistakably of its place.

Chef Stefano uses the same fermentation discipline as classic Neapolitan pizzerias (72+ hours), but sources seafood from Barcelona's markets, vegetables from local farms, and spices from the Boqueria.

## The Philosophy

"We're not making Neapolitan pizza in Naples," Stefano says. "We're making pizza in Barcelona, using what's best here."

This approach creates dishes like **Bombas & Alioli** (Barcelona's famous potato dish reimagined as pizza topping) and **Gambas al Ajillo** (garlic shrimp, a tapas staple transformed into pizza).

## Signature Pizza

**Escalivada** — Roasted vegetables with burrata and romesco. Barcelona-centric, seasonal, beautiful. The vegetables are charred in the pizza oven before assembly.

**Anchovy, Egg & Breadcrumb** — A modern take on traditional toppings. Soft-boiled egg draped over fermented dough, finished with crispy breadcrumbs. Elegant and simple.

## Why It Matters

Lo Grec proves that innovation doesn't require abandoning tradition. The best modern pizza respects Neapolitan fundamentals while celebrating local identity.

# Pizzeria Al Taglio

## The Concept

Roman pizza *al taglio* (by the cut) is different from Neapolitan. Higher hydration, longer fermentation, thinner, crispier. Gabriele Bonci took this tradition and elevated it through ingredient obsession and precise execution.

Walk into Al Taglio and you're overwhelmed by choice—dozens of trays displaying endless pizza variations. The colors are natural: deep greens from fresh vegetables, golden from proper fermentation, whites from quality cheese.

## The Philosophy

The dough is the star. Everything else serves it. Bonci sources obscure wheat varieties, monitors water chemistry, and ferments for 48-72 hours. This creates complex, subtle flavors that simple quick-rise dough can't achieve.

Each topping is selected for how it complements the dough, not for novelty or trend.

## What to Order

**Romana Classica** — Tomato, basil, mozzarella. Pure and perfect. The crust has a delicate crunch, soft interior.

**Zucchini & Pecorino** — Sweet courgette, aged pecorino, excellent olive oil. The vegetable adds subtle sweetness balanced by savory cheese.

**Anchovy & Tomato** — Intense, balanced, traditional. The fermentation brings out umami in both anchovy and tomato.

## Why It Matters

Al Taglio made Roman pizza aspirational. It proved that tradition—not rebellion—creates innovation. Every pizzeria doing elevated Roman pizza owes something to Bonci's influence.
